# WOIN Character Assistant

I stumbled upon the WOIN RPG (http://www.woinrpg.com/) and fell in love with it.  I was unable to find any applications to assist in keeping track of the character creation process, so I decided to try and make one.  This program assists in the character creation process for the WOIN RPG.
