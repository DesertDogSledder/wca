This directory contains examples of how to add your own custom careers, races, homeworlds, and exploits.  Remove the .example extension from the example files you wish to incorporate.  Inside the files is an example commented out with # symbols.  Using the template, add one or more instances of your custom content in the designated section of the file.  Upon launching WCA, you should be able to see your new content within the appropriate sections.


Additional notes:
* Python is heavily dependent on formatting and whitespace.  Be sure that your content follows the same spacing as the examples.  Indentations are four spaces each.
* Don't forget to include the "custom_*.append(*)" statements noted in the examples.
